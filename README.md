# Roguelike

This is a game project by Alex and Martin. The idea is a roguelike game with text commands and ascii graphics. The game is in development. 

The game differs from rogue by not having true permadeath (saves are not deleted) and by not having a randomly generated map.

The game uses the library ncurses to handle keyboardevents and display the interface of the game with ascii characters.
